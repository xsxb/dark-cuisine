## The Game

### "Shadow and Alchemy" theme interpretation
'Dark Cuisine' is a translation of the Chinese expression "黑暗料理“,
which is used to describe cooking or a combination of ingredients that
others would deem disgusting or even deeply disturbing. An example of that would be ketchup on ice cream or pineapple on pizza.

The game is about n alchemist who dabbles in the dark arts is summoned to create an army of evil for his dark lord. However, he ran out of ingredients and has to resort to half empty ketchup bottles and the leftovers from last night's pizza party.
